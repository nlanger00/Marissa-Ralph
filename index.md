## Merry Christmas Marissa!
I love you so much. There is no other person I would ask for in my life besides you. 

I forget about all of my responsibilities and stresses when I'm with you. I feel like a kid again and I love it.

Here are some of my favorite things about you.

## Humor
It seems kind of silly when I say it in such a serious way, but I really love that we can laugh about all the same things. You think my stupid stuff is funny and admire it and I couldn't ask for more. Not a single person that I talked to on any dating app was as easy and fun, or made me laugh as much as you did just over text.
I would always reassure Cameron and my friends before you really spoke to them that you had the same humor and would get along with them as much as I do. You showed even beyond that when you talked to them and made them laugh and laughed with us the one night we all were hanging out.

PICTURE HERE FUCKER

## Beauty
Sexy fuck. Unbelievably. Every single picture you send of yourself is a blessing. You always think you look terrible in them but every single day multiple times a day I go through my album of your photos, just to see your smile and feel how it warms my heart. I know it's hard for you to see it but to me no one compares to you, you are a dream. Waking up next to you and seeing your face is a feeling I never imagined I would love as much as I do with you. Even if we fuss around so much when we sleep.

PICTURE PICTUE PICTE

## Pets Girl
You love your pets as much as I love mine and they are all beautiful little beings. Even Tater when she isn't being a raging horny bitch. Kind of. She also scares me a lot.
The love you have for Binx is extremely endearing to me along with how much you even love Booker, they all love you so much too. The way Booker always comes to see you makes me so happy, you are his Cleopatra, on god.
